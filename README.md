This project was completed in partial fulfillment of the requirement for EN.601.509(50) advised by Dr. Joshua Vogelstein<br>

# Introduction

The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate programming language competency and comprehensive understanding of scikit learn API in various bioinformatic applications. Coding practicals were followed as instructed in *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems 2nd Edition*, and shown in Jupyter notebook. Additionally contained in this repository are study notes, book equations, and helpful compilations of coding examples on numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.

# Derivated Projects

Following short projects are derived from the use of scikit-learn API (latest first).
